cgr: R Functions for Columbia Glacier Research
=====================

All the scripts (`scripts/*`) that generate the data files (`data/*`) in the [columbia-glacier](https://github.com/columbia-glacier) data repositories are written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Of these, many require the R package `cgr` contained in this repository. Although not available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), it can be installed using the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:

```
devtools::`install_github("columbia-glacier/cgr")`
```
